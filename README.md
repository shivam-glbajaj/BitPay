 BitPay: Generalising Bitcoin for everyday payments

BitPay - Decentralized Transaction Application
BitPay is a decentralized transaction application built on blockchain technology. It provides a secure and transparent platform for users to conduct peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries. With Coin Trust, users can transfer digital assets securely and trustlessly, ensuring the integrity and immutability of their transactions.

Features
